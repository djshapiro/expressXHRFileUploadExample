Here's how to upload mp3s from the browser to an Express back-end. This is specifically for mp3s (note that the server code saves the file as an mp3), but it should work for any file type.

1) npm install
2) node serverForFileUploads.js
3) open clientForFileUploads.html. This will open the client in your browser.
4) Upload an mp3 in the client.
5) Find a copy of uploaded mp3 in this very folder. It should play and behave just like a normal mp3, because that's what it is!
